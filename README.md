## 2. üöß Identified Problem

- **Difficulty in Connecting Talent:**  
  - Companies face challenges finding specialized researchers, as many talents struggle to position themselves in the market. According to the study *"Getting an Academic Research Position: Challenges Faced by Researchers"* (Springer Nature), 75% of researchers find it difficult to secure a position, and 52% cite identifying opportunities as one of the biggest obstacles. These findings highlight a mismatch between available talent and market demands, impeding effective connections between companies and researchers.  
  - Companies report difficulties locating relevant academic expertise.

  [Getting an Academic Research Position: Challenges Faced by Researchers](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/the-link/blog/blogposts-news-initiatives/getting-an-academic-research-position/25475206)

- **Devaluation of Academic Knowledge:**  
  - Due to the systemic devaluation of academics‚Äîevidenced by stagnant wages, precarious contracts, and heavy reliance on adjunct work‚Äîonly a small fraction of researchers can transform their knowledge into sustainable income streams. This reality reflects an erosion in the value attributed to research, where intellectual effort rarely translates into adequate compensation.

  **Reference:**  
  [Reckoning with the Devaluation of Academic Knowledge and Research](https://academeblog.org/2025/02/13/reckoning-with-the-devaluation-of-academic-knowledge-and-research/)

- **Challenges in Ensuring Originality:**  
  - Studies using automated tools like iThenticate have found that about 18% of submissions exhibit significant similarity levels (over 20% matching), indicating persistent challenges in maintaining originality and proper source attribution in academic work.

  **Reference:**  
  [Scientific misconduct: Plagiarism and non-compliance with disclosure of interest](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877056823001548)

- **Risks in Privately Funded Partnerships:**  
  - The growing influence of industry funding has led to restrictive agreements on the disclosure of research findings. Research indicates that many consultancy contracts are not adequately reviewed by institutions, resulting in weak contractual structures and increased legal and ethical risks associated with informal partnerships.

  **Reference:**  
  [When big companies fund academic research, the truth often comes last](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9039120/)

*This gap between industry and academia limits innovation and competitiveness, underlining the need for a robust solution.*
